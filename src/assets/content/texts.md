### LinkedIn Summary

Create and build technology-based products is a crazy thing and I love it. It's fascinating how the connection of users, design, technology, and business can transform the world, and how challenging it is. In the last 5 years, I had the opportunity to understand the user problems and apply certain methodologies, use a variety of design tools and connect with specialized stakeholders to have a close business context to help people and companies go forward and boost their products and services through design and technology.

I have to say that since I was in high school I became a daily learner of technology. My first passion was coding and eventually, I discovered that I love to create things and improve people's lives with design.
