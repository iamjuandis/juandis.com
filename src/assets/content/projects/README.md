## Proper

#### Headline

Shaping a new & open real estate investment experience.

#### Role

I was responsible for leading and managing the project, and collaborating in the user experience & interface design. Also, I develop from scratch the functional web prototype to get precise and deep feedback from users.

#### Company

We Are Angular, Colombia

#### Years

2019 - 2020

#### Overview

Proper (formerly Squarepin) is a real estate platform founded in Colombia and Mexico. It mainly focuses on making easier and secure the real estate investment process. We worked side-by-side with real estate experts from Mexico and Colombia, which helped us to understand and illustrate the constraints and opportunities for the users.

#### Problem

When Squarepin/Proper came to us, a market study was already done. This study showed us that we needed to focus on a big problem: How to make real estate investment easiest and more accessible reducing intermediary complexity.

#### We needed to understand

- The current state and context of invest in Real Estate in Colombia.
- The technology and security involved in the process.
- Of course, the user perspective, constraints, and pain points.

#### Process

To decide how to proceed, we focused on 4 specific issues:

- Intermediation
- Safety
- Accessibility
- Time

We used surveys, interviews, and focus groups, to understand from first hand the pain points and put together the main elements to illustrate a user context. Thanks to the business vision and the user discoveries, we built the prototype to test it on users, this helped Squarepin to find partners and advance the project to a new and functional prototype.

#### Discovery

Talking with users and experts, we found that we should focus on the next specific principles that would allow us to build a better and comprehensive product:

- Usability
- Diversity
- Security
- Ownership
- Openness

#### Next steps

In order to build a definitve solution, keeping in mind the complexity of the business and model, we are working on a strategy to keep researching on users, testing the prototype and including new incremental features to get the first MVP on te market.

#### Conclusion

Personally, it was a big journey where I had the opportunity to discover new knowledge, be curious, and show the value of design building a user-based product. Initially, I was intimidated by the complexity of the business and the whole market. I had no idea about real estate, but the curiosity and love to build, got me to understand from experts how the market works, and see how important is to make it easy for the users.

## Aurora

#### Headline

Designing a new accessible and efficient eLearning tool.

#### Role

Since my partners and I founded Aurora in May 2020, I have had the opportunity to be part of a bold and resilient design team. We built Aurora from sketching our first wireframe to Design our first MVP that allowed us to reach our first alliances and +2K users. Currently, I had the challenge to be the Head of Product and sometimes a Frontend Developer comrade.

#### Company

Aurora, Colombia

#### Years

2020 - Present

#### Overview

One of the biggest problems and opportunities in Latin America, especially in countries like Colombia, is education, and the equity in its accessibility. We know it by self-experience, and to help to solve this problem, we decided to build a unique tool to give people an efficient and more accessible e-learning tool. So we built Aurora, an eLearning company that wants to change education in Latam by using technology and design to build an efficient, reliable, and accessible platform where students, employees, and companies can improve their skills and strengths.

#### Problem

Education in Latam has many threads that need to be enhanced, and to support that improvement we focused on: how to improve the engagement and high results in eLearning courses for workers in Latam?

#### Understand the main steps in an e-learning flow

- Content
- Medium
- Evaluation

#### Process

We started building a non-functional prototype that rapidly became a functional MVP, that we validated with around +50 users thanks to alliances with learning organizations and universities. Meanwhile, we were able to work with experts and understand the complexity of education. We started creating content and a course focused on Biosecurity in Delivery workers and Messenger. Once we have access to our first users, we got a special partnership with Pacífico Task Force, a Ford Foundation non-profit organization, to impact the Pacific region in Colombia through Aurora.

#### Discovery

We know Aurora has a long path to drive through, and we strongly believe that design is a huge element to improve and build a better learning tool.
To deliver value constantly, we focused on methodologies like SCRUM and Enterprise Design Thinking, where the users come first and the comprehension in education comes second.

#### Next steps

Thanks to the understanding of the financial model and the impact that we can focus on, we start working on a B2B version that includes refined experiences for our daily users and a complete suite to businesses and organizations.

#### Conclusion

This is currently the most ambitious project I've ever been as a leader in design. Also, it has been a huge challenge creating something new in one of the biggest problems in Latam and the impact we can achieve using design to deliver a unique tool.

## Frostbyte

#### Headline

A modern and complete suite to visualize and monitoring real-time data

#### Company

We Are Angular, Colombia

#### Years

2019 - 2020

#### Role

I was the Product Manager & Lead Designer on this project and I was responsible for creating user flows, wireframes, and prototypes, set a roadmap, prioritize features and collaborate with outside stakeholders, developers, and another UX Designer. Also, I had the opportunity to have a personal perspective of the development process participating as a Frontend Developer.

#### Overview

Frostbyte is a company that helps industrial food companies to control and monitor their storehouses and giant refrigerators and save money alerting and notifying important and unusual behaviors on temperature, operations, and environment variables.

#### Problem

The challenge was how to visualize a huge amount of data and the complexity to integrate a monitoring system to control limits and optimize the performance and excessive expenses in energy. Besides, Frostbyte already had a monitoring system but with a lot of improvement opportunities and specific pain points list.

#### The output

After a very intense month of observation, interviews, and field research, we were not only focused on the visualization problem, but we need to focus on a SaaS solution. Frostbyte customers needed to visualize clearly and in real-time all of their sensors and alerts data. Based on technology and budget, we couldn't deliver a full and customizable product, so we focused on a simple, usable, and efficient way to perceive the current storehouses environmental status.

#### We got

- **+91%** less time to collect and visualize data
- **+20K** data points per week
- **+400**% more revenue

#### The future

The complexity and huge amount of data in monitoring environment variables would result in a challenging task to spend the fewer resources, equipment, and money possible, so one of the main solutions for those industries was a real-time dashboard, simple, reliable, and useful.
Thanks to that renewal, Frostbyte reduced +91% the time spent on data visualization and increased the revenue by +400%.

## Get2Wear

#### Headline

A refined experience to make profitable and manage unique and special clothing

#### Company

We Are Angular, Colombia

#### Years

2020 - 2021

#### Role

I had the opportunity to be the Design Leader for this project. I was responsible for define and propose a user flow, wireframes, and a prototype that eventually would be handed to developers where I also participated as a Frontend Developer.

#### Overview

Get2Wear is a sustainable fashion Startup that focuses on giving people the opportunity to make profitable their special dresses. After a first iteration Get2Wear discovered that they would need to improve how users add their products to Get2Wear. Before this process was made by hand, and through a non-reliable user form and a complicated way to manage and visualize the first step of the logistics behind the business.

#### Problem

Thanks to the growth obtained in their first year running the business, they started to noticed the complexity to load a new product to Get2Wear, so they partnered with us to redesign and refine the user experience and give customers a better way to make their dresses profitable, and in the other hand, have better management of the customers status, and the internal billing and logistic variables.

#### How we did it

- All starts with a closer view to the current perception of users, how that complexity is taking their experience down and what else can we discover.
- Then we took the previous user flow and we made a new one including additional features that would be tested with end-users and admin users.
- We built a refined application with improved feedback, a clear user flow, and a clean interface that lets the most important actions be presented to the user.

#### Conclusion

I feel really motivated when all we do as designers is improve people's lives and help companies grow or even validate business opportunities. This was a validation case and for me, was a sign of pride and conviction to be part of an early-stage business opportunity from a product design position. Besides, it let me a list of personal and professional improvements that I'm hungry to work on.
