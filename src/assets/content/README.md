## Proper

#### Headline

Shaping a new & open real estate investment experience.

#### Role

I led the project, the user interface and experience design for the first and last functional prototype. Also, I develop from scratch the functional web prototype to get precise and deep feedback about the product.

#### Company

We Are Angular, Colombia

#### Overview

Proper (formerly Squarepin) is a real estate platform founded in Colombia and Mexico. It mainly focuses on making it easier and secure the real estate investment process. We worked side-by-side with real estate experts from Mexico and Colombia, that helped us to understand and illustrate the constraints and opportunities.

#### Problem

When Squarepin came to us, a market study was already done. This study showed us that we needed to focus on a big problem: How to make real estate investment easiest and more accessible reducing intermediary complexity.

#### Understand

- Understand the current flow to invest in Real Estate.
- Understand the technology involved in the process.
- Understand the whole new investment flow and the user perspective.

#### Focus

We focused on 4 main problems:

- Bureaucracy
- Safety
- Accessibility
- Time

Thanks to the vision and the discoveries found in the first iteration, we built the first functional prototype to keep testing on users.In this new iteration I had the opportunity to lead the design process and the Frontend Development.

#### Discovery

Talking with users and experts, we found that we should focus on the next specific principles that would allow us to build a comprehensive product.

- Easy to use
- Diverse
- Secure
- “You are the owner”
- Open

#### Conclusion

Personally, it was a big journey where I had the opportunity to discover new knowledge, be curious, and show the value of design building an user-based product.

## Aurora

## Headline

Designing a new accessible and efficient eLearning tool.

#### Role

Since my partners and I founded Aurora in May 2020, I have had the opportunity to be part of a bold and resilient design team. We built Aurora from sketching our first wireframe, to Design our first MVP that allowed us to reach our first alliances and +2K users. Currently, I had the challenge to be the Head of Product and sometimes a Frontend Developer comrade.
