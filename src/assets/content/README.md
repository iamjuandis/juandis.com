## Proper

#### Headline

Shaping a new & open real estate investment experience.

#### Role

I was responsible for leading and managing the project, and collaborating in the user experience & interface design. We got the challenge to understand the business, context and users to build a functional prototype. Also, I develop from scratch the functional web prototype to get precise and deep feedback from users.

#### Company

We Are Angular, Colombia

#### Overview

Proper (formerly Squarepin) is a real estate platform founded in Colombia and Mexico. It mainly focuses on making it easier and secure the real estate investment process. We worked side-by-side with real estate experts from Mexico and Colombia, that helped us to understand and illustrate the constraints and opportunities for the users.

#### Problem

When Squarepin/Proper came to us, a market study was already done. This study showed us that we needed to focus on a big problem: How to make real estate investment easiest and more accessible reducing intermediary complexity. 

#### We needed to understand

- The current state and context of invest in Real Estate in Colombia.
- The technology and security involved in the process.
- Of course, the user perspective, constraints and pain points.

#### Process

To decide how to proceed, we focused on 4 specific issues:

- Intermediation 
- Safety
- Accessibility
- Time

We used surveys, interviews and focus groups, to understand from first hand the pain points and put together the main elements to illustrate a user context. Thanks to the business vision and the user discoveries, we built a first prototype to test it on users, this helped Squarepin to find partners and advance the project to a new and functional prototype.

#### Discovery

Talking with users and experts, we found that we should focus on the next specific principles that would allow us to build a batter and comprehensive product:

- Usability
- Diversity
- Security 
- Ownership
- Openness 

#### Next steps

In order to build a definitve solution, keeping in mind the complexity of the business and model, we are working on a strategy to keep researching on users, testing the prototype and including new incremental features to get the first MVP on te market. 

#### Conclusion

Personally, it was a big journey where I had the opportunity to discover new knowledge, be curious, and show the value of design building an user-based product. Initially, I was intimidated by the complexity of the business and the whole market, I had no idea about real estate, but the curiosity and love to build, got me to understand from experts how the market works, and hwo important is to make it easy for the users.

## Aurora

#### Headline

Designing a new accessible and efficient eLearning tool.

#### Role

Since my partners and I founded Aurora in May 2020, I have had the opportunity to be part of a bold and resilient design team. We built Aurora from sketching our first wireframe, to Design our first MVP that allowed us to reach our first alliances and +2K users. Currently, I had the challenge to be the Head of Product and sometimes a Frontend Developer comrade.

#### Company

Aurora, Colombia

#### Overview

One of the biggest problems and opportunities in Latin America, specially in countries like Colombia, is the education, and the equity in its accessibility. We know it by self experience, and in order to help to solve this problem, we decided to build a unique tool to give people an efficient and more accesible e-learning tool. So we built Aurora, a eLearning company that wants to change education in Latam by using technology and design to build an efficient, reliable and accessible platform where students, employees and companies can improve their skills and strengths.  

#### Problem 

Education in Latam has many threads that need to be enhanced, and in order to support that improvement we focused on: how to improve the engagement and high results in eLearning courses for workers in Latam?

#### Understand the main steps in an e-learning flow

- Content
- Medium
- Evaluation

#### Process 

We started building a non-functional prototype that rapidly became a functional MVP, that we validated with around +50 users thanks to alliances with learning organizations and universities. Meanwhile we were able to work with experts and understand the complexity of education. We started creating content and a course focused on Biosecurity in Delivery workers and Messenger. Once we have acces to our first users, we got a special partnership with Pacífico Task Force, a Ford Fundation non-profit organization, to impact the Pacific region in Colombia through Aurora. 

#### Discovery

We know Aurora have a long path to drive through, and we strongly belive that design is a huge element to improve and build a better learning tool.
In order to deliver value constantly, we focused on methologies as SCRUM and Enterprise Design Thinking, where the users come first and the comprehension in education comes secondly. 

#### Next steps

Thanks to the understaning of the financial model and the impact that we can focus on, we start working on a B2B version that includes refined experiences to our deily users and a complete suite to business and organizaions. 

#### Conclusion

This is currently the most ambitious project I've ever been as a leader in design. Also it has been a huge challenge creating something new in one of the biggest problems in latam and the impact we can achieve using design to deliver a unique tool.

## Frostbyte

#### Headline

A modern and complete suite to visualize and monitoring realtime data

#### Company

We Are Angular, Colombia

#### Overview

Frostbyte is a company that helps industrial food companies to control and monitor their storehouses and gigant refrigerators and save money alerting and notifying important and unusual behaviors on temperature, operations and environment variables. 

#### Problem

The challenge was how to visualize a huge amount of data and the complexity to integrate a monitoring system to controll limits and optimize the performance and excesive expenses in energy. Besides, Frostbyte already had a monitoring system but wit a lot of improvement opportunities and a specific pain points list.

#### The output 

After a very intense month of observation, interviews and field research, we were not only focused on the visualization problem, but we need to focus on a SaaS solution. Frostbyte customers, needed to visualize clearly and in realtime all of their sensors and alerts data. Based on technology and budget, we couldn't deliver a full and personalizable product, so we focused on a simple, usable and eficient wey to perceive the current storehouses environmental status. 

#### We got

- **+91%** less time to recolect and visualize data

+ **+20K** data points per week
+ **+400** more revenue

#### The future

The complexity and huge amount of data in monitoring environment variables would result on a challenging task to spend the less resources, equipement and money possible, so one of the main solutions for those industries was a realtime dashboard, simple, reliable and useful. 
In fact, thanks to that renewal, Frostbyte reduced +91% the time spent on data visualization and increased the revenue on a +400%.

I had the opportunity to be part of the journey from 2017, since then, I have worked as developer, designer, consultant, project manager and board member. Back in 2020, after a complicated inter-pandemic scenario, we started to reinvent ourselves.

#### Conclusion

This is one of those projects that I'm very proud of. Not only for the results behind that, but also for the process, execution and decitions made to do it better. I had the challenge to take the driver seat and get a diverse team together to involve strategy, marketing, business, design and technology decisions in order to refresh our whole company.
