## Proper

#### Headline

Shaping a new & open real estate investment experience.

#### Role

I was responsible for leading and managing the project, and collaborating in the user experience & interface design. We got the challenge to understand the business, context and users to build a functional prototype. Also, I develop from scratch the functional web prototype to get precise and deep feedback from users.

#### Company

We Are Angular, Colombia

#### Overview

Proper (formerly Squarepin) is a real estate platform founded in Colombia and Mexico. It mainly focuses on making it easier and secure the real estate investment process. We worked side-by-side with real estate experts from Mexico and Colombia, that helped us to understand and illustrate the constraints and opportunities for the users.

#### Problem

When Squarepin/Proper came to us, a market study was already done. This study showed us that we needed to focus on a big problem: How to make real estate investment easiest and more accessible reducing intermediary complexity. 

#### We needed to understand

- The current state and context of invest in Real Estate in Colombia.
- The technology and security involved in the process.
- Of course, the user perspective, constraints and pain points.

#### Process

To decide how to proceed, we focused on 4 specific issues:

- Intermediation 
- Safety
- Accessibility
- Time

We used surveys, interviews and focus groups, to understand from first hand the pain points and put together the main elements to illustrate a user context. Thanks to the business vision and the user discoveries, we built a first prototype to test it on users, this helped Squarepin to find partners and advance the project to a new and functional prototype.

#### Discovery

Talking with users and experts, we found that we should focus on the next specific principles that would allow us to build a batter and comprehensive product:

- Usability
- Diversity
- Security 
- Ownership
- Openness 

#### Next steps

In order to build a definitve solution, keeping in mind the complexity of the business and model, we are working on a strategy to keep researching on users, testing the prototype and including new incremental features to get the first MVP on te market. 

#### Conclusion

Personally, it was a big journey where I had the opportunity to discover new knowledge, be curious, and show the value of design building an user-based product. Initially, I was intimidated by the complexity of the business and the whole market, I had no idea about real estate, but the curiosity and love to build, got me to understand from experts how the market works, and hwo important is to make it easy for the users.

#### Role

Since my partners and I founded Aurora in May 2020, I have had the opportunity to be part of a bold and resilient design team. We built Aurora from sketching our first wireframe, to Design our first MVP that allowed us to reach our first alliances and +2K users. Currently, I had the challenge to be the Head of Product and sometimes a Frontend Developer comrade.

#### Company

#### Overview

One of the biggest problems and opportunities in Latin America, specially in countries like Colombia, is the education, and the equity in its accessibility. We know it by self experience, and in order to help to solve this problem, we decided to build a unique tool to give people an efficient and more accesible e-learning tool. So we built Aurora, a eLearning company that wants to change education in Latam by using technology and design to build an efficient, reliable and accessible platform where students, employees and companies can improve their skills and strengths.  

#### Problem 

Education in Latam has many threads that need to be enhanced, and in order to support that improvement we focused on: how to improve the engagement and high results in eLearning courses?
